# HM5
This is the repository that contains material related to homework5 for the course Algorithmic Methods for Data Science

so i uploaded HM5-draft_Kat.ipynb, i changes only part 1, finally we received undirected graph. i checked it with Adjacency lists as for this check we have only two options Adjacency lists and Adjacency matrix(matrix is even more consuming, so it's the only way).

and i also changed formula of computing density of graph, as in Wiki formula with 2 in numerator, so i decided that its right.

also i wrote another code for computing average degree of nodes, but we don't need it as for undirected graphs we can use Samin's code.
